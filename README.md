# Reversi-AI
A neural network for the game Reversi. Trained using a Genetic Algorithm.

Run [AI.py](https://github.com/MonliH/Reversi-AI/blob/master/AI_Reversi/AI.py) to train. Make sure to set the previous generations (variable in line 11) to the previous generation.

To play againt the AI, run [reversi_play.py](https://github.com/MonliH/Reversi-AI/blob/master/AI_Reversi/reversi_play.py) and set the generation (variable in line 6) to the generation you want to play against. Also make sure that the training files are in the same directory as the code. (e,g make sure gen2500 is in AI_Reversi).

## Dependencies
* Python 3
* [NumPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy/) `pip install numpy`
